* There is *no* need for confirmation. I will receive an alert when you schedule a meeting with me. 
* Briefly indicate the reason for the meeting. 
* *All kinds of questions/concerns are welcomed*. 
* While I encourage you to make an appointment in advance, my doors are always open. Feel free to stop by.
* **I am looking forward to meeting you!**
