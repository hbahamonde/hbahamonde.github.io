In this section I will describe *my* take on literate programming: not the best, not the only one. Just the one I use.

The main idea is to outsource your `R` code into `LaTeX` automatically. For example, this way you do not have to copy and paste standard errors, or figures. It will be automatically generated in your PDF file after compiling the `.rnw`.

* Text processor and necessary dependencies: First you will need a software to handle code and syntax highlighting. I use [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). Have Sublime Text 3 [installed](http://www.sublimetext.com/3).

* Inside Sublime Text:
    * Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).
    * `shift+cmd+p`, then **Install Packages**, and install:
        * [R-Box](https://github.com/randy3k/R-Box).
        * [Sublime Knitr](https://github.com/andrewheiss/SublimeKnitr).
        * [SendCode](https://github.com/randy3k/SendREPL)
        * [LaTexing](http://www.latexing.com/installation.html) or [LaTeX Tools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools).


* In **R** you have to install **knitr**:

```r
install.packages(c("knitr", "formatR", "pacman"), repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
```

* In Sublime Text 3, modify **user** settings **in LaTeXing**. First line adds *knitr* capabilities, while the second line allows *BibTeX* compilation.

```tex
{"knitr": true, /* activates knitr function */
"quick_build": [ /* activates latexing capabilities? Not sure. */
    {
        "name": "Primary Quick Build: latexmk",
        "primary": true,
        "cmds": ["latexmk"]
    }
                ],
    "keep_focus": true, /* activates skim sync and pop up function */
    "keep_focus_delay": 0.1, /* reduces skim sync time */
    "pdf_viewer_osx": { /* makes sure skim is the default app. User should make sure that the NAME OF the app is correct too (it might change with some updates) */
        "skim": [
            "/Applications/Skim.app"
        ],
        "preview": [
            "/Applications/Preview.app"
        ]
    }

}
```

* Writing **R** and **LaTeX** code together:


1) In your `.rnw` file, just generate an environment that includes a tag that's shared with the `R` file, like so:

```r
<<chunk:example, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE>>=

@ 
```

In this example, the tag is `chunk:example`. Also, editors and (**most**) readers are **not** interested in your coding. That's fine. The important thing is to make your code available to the audience that needs it. You can hide it by calling the `echo = FALSE` function in the preamble, i.e. within the `<<>>=` symbols. Also, the `cache = FALSE` makes sure that your computer does not store whatever you command it to do (graphs, data, etc.). I think it's important to set it in `FALSE` so fresh plots, tables, and datasets are generated every time. This way you are absolutely sure that whatever is in your PDF reflects the latest compile.


2) In your R script, have another environment where you actually host the code, like so:

```r
## ---- chunk:example
set.seed(602)
library(MASS) # to generate multi-var distribution
e <-  as.numeric(mvrnorm(n = 100, mu = 0, Sigma = 1))
plot(e)
##
```

Thus, every time you compile your `.rnw` file, `R` will execute the `chunk:example` chunk, and insert whatever is there (a table, a plot, a number, etc.).

Some people prefer having the `R` code within the `.rnw` file. My `R` code is always very long, which distracts me from writing. Thus, I prefer to have my `R` code separated from the `.rnw` file. It's easily shareable, and more convenient.



* Downloadable examples: [rnw file](https://github.com/hbahamonde/hbahamonde.github.io/blob/master/resources/literate_prog_ex.r) and [r file](https://github.com/hbahamonde/hbahamonde.github.io/blob/master/resources/literate_prog_ex.Rnw). Copy and paste these contents and make sure the file extension is .rnw and .r.
